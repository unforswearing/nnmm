# Installing nnmm on a server
> since I forget how to to do this between installs / am not good at php

- Install LAMP stack on a server
- Get nnmm

```
# ssh $MY_SERVER
cd /var/www/html/
git clone https://github.com/unforswearing/nnmm.git
```

- edit index.php to update $user, $pass, and $database
  - also can edit other variables, if that is yr thing

- Add $user to mysql

```
CREATE USER '$user'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY '$pass'
WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 100 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 100;
```

- Allow '$user' access to $database

```
USE $database;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO '$user'@'localhost';
```

Navigate to $MY_SERVER in your browser. If everything went well you will see the nnmm README file.
